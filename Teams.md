# How to "Team"
1. For next couple minutes you'll be in a breakout with your team and decide on a team leader
   - Leader will be responsible for the overall performance of the team.
   - Leadership is not set in stone. Can be rotated if the entire team wishes to change leadership.
   - Leaders will conduct stand ups and update the stand up forms.
2. Standups
   - They are essentially a quick meeting for each team and team members will state what they aim to finish today, what was done yesterday, and any blockers they have.
   - A blocker is anything they are having problems with and impeding their progress.
   - Blockers must be managed/resolved either through entire team effort or the leader.
   - Standup forms is then given to me to evaluate.
3. Feel free to add a nickname to the team
   - Those team names is universal meaning each batch in Revature right now is either in Team Synergy, Amplifire, Vanquish, and Alchemy
   - However, you can attach a nickname to it (I prefer you do and be creative like code, compile, and pray Team)

# Living Document
* Team objectives they must complete
* Team objectives might change since it is a living document
* Objective 1 - Create a User interface that allows you to add a customer
   * For now, keep properties that points to another class/object null such as List<class> properties
   * A new customer shouldn't have pre-existing list of orders anyway (as an example)
   * You can perhaps initiliaze a new object for that properties is also possible
   * You don't need to attach it to a json file as of right now (you can if you finished early)
* Objective 2 - Create a store interface that shows a list of products and customer can choose a product to buy
   * Use pre-filled json file for now to populate the list of products and worry about adding those products later
   * Just make sure when a user buys the product the amount of quantity of that product decreases
   * You can also choose to hard code a list of products for now just to see if you can decrease its quantity when you test your code
