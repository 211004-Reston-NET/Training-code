# How to "Team"
1. For next couple minutes you'll be in a breakout with your team and decide on a team leader
   - Leader will be responsible for the overall performance of the team.
   - Leadership is not set in stone. Can be rotated if the entire team wishes to change leadership.
   - Leaders will conduct stand ups and update the stand up forms.
2. Standups
   - They are essentially a quick meeting for each team and team members will state what they aim to finish today, what was done yesterday, and any blockers they have.
   - A blocker is anything they are having problems with and impeding their progress.
   - Blockers must be managed/resolved either through entire team effort or the leader.
   - Standup forms is then given to me to evaluate.
3. Feel free to add a nickname to the team
   - Those team names is universal meaning each batch in Revature right now is either in Team Synergy, Amplifire, Vanquish, and Alchemy
   - However, you can attach a nickname to it (I prefer you do and be creative like code, compile, and pray Team)

# Living Document
* Team objectives they must complete
* Team objectives might change since it is a living document
* Objective 1 - Update project to be a code-first approach
* Objective 2 - Update terminal UI to website UI using ASP.net (this will probably take forever)
   * Add a customer (sign up process)
   * Sign in as customer (or search for a customer)
      * I would look into asp.net identity for a proper sign up but not required
   * View store location
   * View store location's inventory
* Objective 3 - Setup pipeline
